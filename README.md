# Genomelink

Reflecting on my collaboration with Genomelink, a pioneer in unlocking the secrets of DNA data for the everyday person, my engagement centered around leveraging my design expertise to enhance their social ads campaigns. Genomelink sets itself apart by making DNA data accessible, offering intuitive visualizations alongside scientifically educational and entertaining content. This innovative approach has positioned them as a new standard for individuals eager to explore their genetic identity.

### My Role

My involvement with Genomelink was focused on assisting with the design of their social ads. This role tasked me with not only creating visually appealing advertisements but also ensuring these designs were effective in communicating the unique value Genomelink offers. My goal was to capture the audience's imagination and spark curiosity about their own DNA data through compelling visuals and messaging.

### Design Process

To achieve this, I embarked on a comprehensive design process that involved several key steps:

1. **Interviews:** My first step was to conduct interviews with potential and existing Genomelink users. This allowed me to gather insights into their interests, motivations, and the type of content that resonates with them. Understanding the audience's perspective was crucial in tailoring the social ads to meet their needs and preferences.

2. **Persona Development:** From the insights gathered, I developed detailed personas representing Genomelink's target audience. These personas helped guide my design decisions, ensuring that the social ads would appeal to the specific characteristics and interests of the intended viewers.

3. **Stakeholderâ€™s Map and Business Model Canvas:** Understanding the broader ecosystem in which Genomelink operates was vital. Mapping out stakeholders and utilizing a business model canvas allowed me to grasp the strategic objectives of Genomelink and how the social ads could align with these goals.

4. **Customer Journey Map and User Journey:** Mapping the customer and user journeys provided a visual representation of the touchpoints where the social ads could have the most impact. This step was instrumental in identifying opportunities to engage the audience and guide them towards exploring their DNA data with Genomelink.

5. **Wireframes, Prototype, and Test:** With a solid understanding of the audience and strategic objectives, I moved on to designing wireframes and prototypes for the social ads. This iterative process involved testing different designs to see which ones were most effective in engaging the audience, with continuous refinement based on feedback.

Throughout this process, I maintained a focus on creating designs that were not only visually attractive but also educational and scientifically accurate. My aim was to demystify the complex world of DNA data, making it accessible and engaging for Genomelink's audience through social ads. This endeavor was a fascinating blend of science, education, and design, offering me the unique opportunity to contribute to the way people learn about and interact with their DNA identity.
